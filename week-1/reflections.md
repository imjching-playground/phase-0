##1.1 Think About Time (medium)
After doing all of the readings and watching all of the videos listed, I decided to focus my research on mindfulness meditation and the Pomodoro Technique.

"Time-boxing" is a method by which you break up work into periods of set time lengths, punctuated by rest periods that are (usually) of a shorter, defined length. The Pomodoro Technique is one implementation of time-boxing, which uses 25 minute work periods with rest periods of about 5 minutes (cute kitchen timer: optional). My current time management strategy is best described as "organic" (i.e. I don't really have one). I tend to get easily distracted if I'm not interested in a task, or hyperfocused for long periods of time if I am interested. I want to try out the Pomodoro Technique, so I downloaded a desktop app. I think it might synergize well with the Fogg Method from the TED Talk video, since I could attach some kind of routine to the break periods. Or maybe it's better to just take a couple minutes and do nothing. I'll have to experiment with that.

I also downloaded a mindfulness meditation app that one of the articles recommended called Headspace. It guides you through a 10-minute daily meditation, which I did today. I don't have a regular meditation practice, so that was a little unusual for me. I'm not sure if it will help directly with time management, but it definitely made me more aware of my thoughts, behaviors, and senses. I didn't even realize I had a sore throat until I took the time to meditate. I'll keep at it.

##1.2 The Command Line (long)
1. A shell is a program that takes commands from the user as text commands in order to interact with the OS (e.g. Unix). Bash is the most common shell for Unix and the default on Macs.

2. The most difficult part is memorizing commands and modifiers. I think that will come with time. It's also hard to grasp certain abstract concepts that I don't have a good frame of reference for; for example, the distinction between a shell and bash is very vague for me, since I don't know what makes bash different from other shells.

3. Yes, I was able to understand and use all of the commands.

4. The most important commands seem to be: pwd, cd, ls, mv, cp, mkdir, rmdir, rm, man. There are also operators like *, ~, ., .. that are very important.

5.

-pwd: print working directory (displays current directory)

-ls: list contents of current directory

-mv: move/rename file or folder (take two parameters: the 1st is the item to be moved/renamed and the 2nd specifies the new name/location)

-cd: changes to the target directory

-../ : can be used in the path to refer to the parent directory

-touch: creates an empty file with the specified name and filetype

-mkdir: create a new directory with the specified name

-less: reads the text of the file on a fresh screen (as opposed to 'more', which reads it on the same screen as the command)

-rmdir: removes the specified directory (will not work if it has contents)

-rm: removes the specified file. Can be used on directories with contents if the -r (recursive) modifier is used.

-help: when used by itself, displays a list of available commands. When a command is used as a parameter, it displays information about that command.
