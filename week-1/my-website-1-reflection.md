###Create a repo on GitHub
1. Log in to GitHub.com and you should see a green "+ New repository" button on the right side of the screen. Press that button.
2. Name your repository whatever you want and set it to public (unless you have a paid GitHub account and don't want your code visible to others). If you don't have a preference or don't know what you're doing, just select an MIT license, readme doc, and press "Create repository".
3. Now you should be on a GitHub page with your new repo in the "master" branch.

###Clone the repo to your local computer
4. On the right side, where it says "HTTPS clone URL", copy the URL.
5. Open terminal on your computer and navigate to the location where you want to store your local files using the **cd [path]** command.
6. Clone the repo on GitHub to your computer with this command: **git clone [the URL you just copied]**

###Open source
Open source means that anyone can view the source code and, in most cases, modify it themselves. Depending on the license, they may also be able to sell their own product based on the original code.

###Thoughts about open source
I think the growing popularity of open source is a great thing. It's great for consumers in several ways:
- it allows people to customize the product to better match their needs.
- if a product becomes abandonware or the company goes out of business, other people can continue to update it.
- open source software tends to follow an unpaid or freemium model, which makes it more accessible to a wider audience.

Open source is also great from the perspective of software historiography. It's a pity that so much historically significant software has been lost, destroyed, or privately archived, even when there is little or no financial incentive to hide it from the public domain.

###Thoughts on this challenge
I spent an enormous amount of time on the *previous* challenges trying to wrap my head around git. By the time I got to this challenge, it seemed like a breeze by comparison. It was nice to be able to execute this so smoothly after struggling through the previous git/GitHub challenges.

On the previous challenges, I had a hard time figuring out the relationship between my local file system and my feature branch. I was also a little unclear about the difference between a fork and a branch. I figured those out before I got to this exercise, though. This exercise I learnt that I can host a website on GitHub and I learnt some differences between open source licenses.

###Other resources used
I just referred back to the previous DBC assignments.
