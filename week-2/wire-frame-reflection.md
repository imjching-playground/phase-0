- What is a wireframe?

A wireframe is a basic outline of the layout of a website.

- What are the benefits of wireframing?

You can plan and move things around without having to rewrite a bunch of code every time.

- Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

Yes, I had a little fun doing it.

- Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

I kept things as I originally drew them, but added some additional things that came to me later.

- What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

I found it to be fairly straightforward, though I'm still looking for a wireframing/mockup tool that suits my needs. I tried balsamiq but was a little overwhelmed by the number of options (way more than I need for this simple challenge). I ended up using moqups.com, which was pretty cool, but I used up all the wireframes I can make with a free account.

- Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy -and which parts did you find tedious?

I enjoyed all of it. The wireframing was kind of repetitive (drawing lots of boxes) but not too bad.
