###1. What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
Information Gathering, Planning, Design, Development, Testing & Delivery, Maintenance

###2. What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
It's main purpose will be informational, with the explicit goal of introducing myself to others and showcasing my abilities to potential employers. There will also be an implicit pitch about why potential employers should hire me.

###3. What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
Target audience is potential employers and other internet stalkers. They are probably trying to learn about my qualifications and what type of person I am. I will present my credentials and proof of my abilities through a "projects" section, while trying to be as "real" as possible (not a sterile sales pitch).

###4. What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
Contact me. Please :)

###5. What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
As with other jobs in technology, it's crucial to keep up with the latest innovations in tools and theory. Designers should use a scientific, user-centered approach - it's not enough to make something that looks cool or is technically impressive, if it isn't effective at what it's supposed to do or enjoyable to use (Flash websites, anyone?).

###6. What is user experience design and why is it valuable?
User experience (UX) design is about creating an enjoyable experience so that the user will be motivated to interact with the website. UX designers aim to remove frustration and tailor sites to their user demographic.

###7. Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
I have a decent grasp of HTML and CSS already, so I found some of the videos that preceded this challenge to be a little redundant. I did find the historical information on HTML very interesting, however.
